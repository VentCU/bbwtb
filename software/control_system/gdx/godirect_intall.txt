### USB stuff 

In order to communicate with Go Direct devices over USB on Linux systems, you will need to provide a special udev rule that allows the device to be identified when it is plugged in. The rule file is located on our github directory. Use the following steps to download the rule file and then move it to the proper location:

        Move the file to the /etc/udev/rules.d directory using super-user privileges.
            Run this command to move the file to the /etc/udev/rules.d directory:
                sudo cp vstlibusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/.

        The rule will not take effect until you plug in a Go Direct device by USB. If a Go Direct device is already connected to the Linux computer, disconnect it and plug it in again. You may need to reboot your device.
