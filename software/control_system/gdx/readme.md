# The gdx Module

The `gdx` module in this folder is used to abstract and simplify interaction with Go DirectÂ® devices. While the implementation of the communication is actually done through the lower level [godirect module](https://pypi.org/project/godirect/), the `gdx` module exposes the features that are most commonly used when writing code that deals with Go Direct devices.

## The gdx module API

### open_usb:
Discovers the Go Direct device with a USB connection and opens that device for data collection. If there are multiple devices discovered, a list of devices is printed to the terminal with a prompt for the user to choose one.

Arguments: None

### open_ble:
Open a Go Direct device via bluetooth for data collection.

Arguments: 
- `device_to_open`: Set to None to receive a list of all discovered Go Direct devices for the user to choose one. Set to a specific Go Direct device name, for example "GDX-FOR 071000U9", to open that device. Set to "proximity_pairing" to open the device with the highest rssi (closest proximity).

### select_sensors:
Select the sensors (by number) to enable for data collection. Note that the sensors are not enabled in this function, that happens in the start() function.

Arguments:
- `sensors` []: if sensors is left blank, a list of all available sensors is provided by a prompt in the terminal for the user to select from. Otherwise, enter a list of sensor numbers such as [1,2,3].

### start:
Enables the sensors that were selected in the select_sensors() function and then starts data collection.

Arguments: 
- `period` (int): If period is left blank, a prompt in the terminal allows the user to enter the period. Otherwise, enter a period in milliseconds, e.g. 1000
